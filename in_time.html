  <h1> In Time: Prototype Video Game Project </h1>
  <figure id="time">
	<p>My game project, In Time, is a project that was made in the RPG Maker Engine for a Senior project for my major, alongside my academic advisor, Dr. Carly A. Kocurek. I used the skills that I learned through previous coursework to create a game that I felt reflected who I am as a person, as well, as showcasing some of the game design skills I've gained.</p>
	<p>Below is a poster created for the project, highlighting the design process in creating the game, as well as providing information on the subject matter and gameplay of the game itself. Also below is a download link of the current finished prototype, though development is still continuing independently of the initial project scope.</p>
