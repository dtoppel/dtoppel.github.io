  <h1>Dennis Toppel: Expanded Web Presence</h1>
   <div>
  <p>I frequently take photographs of natural and urban environments, as well as create environments in games. I aspire to be a game designer, and this site will serve as a portfolio of the different kinds of work that I've done.</p>
  <p>My name is Dennis Toppel, and this is my Web Presence. I currently am a student at IIT, and am taking a Web Design Class. I have a GitHub page which I post my work and updates on said work, and any future projects will also be on my that page too.</p>
